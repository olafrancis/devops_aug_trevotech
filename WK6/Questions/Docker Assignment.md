### **Assignment: Week 6 \- Continuous Integration (CI) with Jenkins**
  
**Task Overview:**

In this task, you will set up a Continuous Integration (CI) environment using Jenkins. This includes installing and configuring Jenkins, creating Jenkins jobs, and integrating Jenkins with a version control system. Additionally, you will create a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkinsfile, configure parameterized builds, build triggers, and set up automated testing and notifications. Finally, you will initialize a Git repository, commit your Jenkins configurations, and share the Git URL.
**Instructions:**
1. Set Up Jenkins
Install Jenkins:
●	Install Jenkins on your local machine or a cloud server (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
●	Document the installation process with screenshots and notes on any issues encountered and how they were resolved.
Initial Configuration:
●	Complete the initial setup wizard.
●	Install suggested plugins.
●	Create an admin user and configure basic security settings.
●	Document each step with screenshots and explanations.
2. Explore Jenkins Plugins
Explore and Install Essential Plugins:
●	Research and install at least 5 plugins that extend Jenkins functionality. These should include:
●	Git Plugin
●	Pipeline Plugin
●	Email Extension Plugin
●	JUnit Plugin
●	Any other plugin of your choice
●	Document the purpose and usage of each plugin with screenshots.
3. Create and Configure Jenkins Jobs
Create a Freestyle Project:
●	Create a simple "Hello World" Jenkins freestyle job.
●	Configure the job to run a shell script that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
●	Document the job creation process with screenshots and script details.
Parameterized Builds:
●	Modify the "Hello World" job to accept a parameter (e.g., a name) and print "Hello, [name]!".
●	Document the changes and provide screenshots showing the job running with different parameters.
Build Triggers:
●	Configure the job to run every 5 minutes using cron syntax.
●	Document the configuration with screenshots and explain how build triggers work.
4. Integrate Jenkins with Version Control Systems
Configure Jenkins with Git:
●	Set up a new Git repository on GitHub or any other Git hosting service.
●	Create a simple project (e.g., a Java application) in the repository.
●	Configure Jenkins to clone the repository and build the project.
●	Document the configuration process with screenshots and details of any issues encountered.
Jenkins Pipeline as Code:
●	Create a Jenkinsfile in your Git repository that defines the CI/CD pipeline.
●	The pipeline should include stages for building, testing, and deploying the application.
●	Configure Jenkins to use the Jenkinsfile and run the pipeline.
●	Document the Jenkinsfile content and pipeline execution with screenshots and explanations.
5. Putting It All Together
Create a Comprehensive CI Job:
●	Create a new Jenkins job that pulls code from your Git repository, runs tests, and deploys the application.
●	Use parameters to allow different deployment environments (e.g., dev, staging, production).
●	Set up email notifications to alert you of build successes or failures.
●	Document the job configuration and execution process with screenshots.
Automated Testing:
●	Integrate a testing framework (e.g., JUnit for Java projects) into your Jenkins pipeline.
●	Ensure that tests are run automatically as part of the build process and that results are reported.
●	Document the setup and results with screenshots and explanations.
6. Initialize Git and Push to Git
Initialize Git Repository:
●	Initialize a Git repository in your project directory using git init.
●	Add all Jenkins configuration files to the repository using git add ..
●	Commit the changes to the repository using git commit -m "Initial commit".
●	Create a remote repository on a Git hosting service like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
●	Add the remote repository URL using git remote add origin <remote_repository_url>.
●	Push the commits to the remote repository using git push -u origin master.
Deliverables:
1.	Documentation:
●	A detailed report covering all parts of the assignment.
●	Include screenshots, code snippets, and explanations for each step.
●	Discuss any challenges faced and how you overcame them.
2.	Source Code:
●	Provide the link to your Git repository containing the project and Jenkinsfile.
3.	Jenkins Configuration:
●	Export and include any relevant Jenkins job configurations.
4.	Git Repository URL:
●	Share the URL of the Git repository containing all Jenkins configurations.
Submission Guidelines:
Submit all Jenkins configuration files, documentation, and Git repository URL through the provided platform or repository. Ensure that your documentation is comprehensive and well-structured, providing clear explanations of each CI/CD component and its configuration.
Evaluation Criteria:
●	Correctness and completeness of the Jenkins configurations.
●	Proper utilization of Jenkins plugins and adherence to best practices in CI/CD.
●	Effective setup of Jenkins jobs and pipeline.
●	Proper configuration of version control integration and automated testing.
●	Successful initialization and configuration of Git repository.
●	Clarity and quality of documentation, including detailed explanations and organization.
Useful Links:
●	Jenkins Installation
●	Jenkins Plugins
●	Jenkins Freestyle Project
●	Jenkins Pipelines
●	Jenkins Git Integration
Good luck with your assignment!
