Sure, I can help you get started with your tasks. Let's break down each task and provide some guidance:

### Task 1: Introduction to Containerization

**Definition and Purpose of Containerization:**
Containerization is a method of packaging an application and its dependencies into a single, lightweight executable unit called a container. This ensures that the application runs consistently across different environments. Containers are isolated from each other and the host system, providing a consistent runtime environment.

**Advantages of Containerization:**
1. **Portability:** Containers can run on any system that supports containerization, making it easy to move applications between different environments¹.
2. **Scalability:** Containers are lightweight and can be easily scaled up or down to handle varying loads¹.
3. **Consistency:** Containers ensure that applications run the same way regardless of where they are deployed².
4. **Efficiency:** Containers use fewer resources compared to virtual machines, leading to better resource utilization¹.

**Comparison of Containerization vs. Virtualization:**
- **Isolation:** Virtual machines (VMs) provide complete isolation with their own operating system, while containers share the host OS kernel¹⁴.
- **Resource Utilization:** Containers are more lightweight and use fewer resources compared to VMs¹⁴.
- **Startup Time:** Containers start up faster than VMs because they do not need to boot an entire operating system¹⁴.
- **Use Cases:** VMs are suitable for running multiple operating systems on a single host, while containers are ideal for microservices and applications that need to be deployed consistently across different environments.

### Task 2: Understanding Docker and Container Basics

**Docker Installation:**
1. Follow the [official Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for your operating system.
2. After installation, run `docker --version` to verify the installation.
3. Provide a screenshot showing Docker running successfully.

**Docker Architecture and Components:**
Docker uses a client-server architecture²³²⁴:
- **Docker Daemon:** The server component that manages Docker objects like images, containers, networks, and volumes²³.
- **Docker Client:** The command-line interface (CLI) that users interact with to send commands to the Docker daemon²³.
- **Docker Images:** Read-only templates used to create Docker containers²³.
- **Docker Containers:** Lightweight, standalone, and executable packages that include everything needed to run a piece of software²³.
- **Docker Registries:** Repositories where Docker images are stored and distributed. Docker Hub is the default public registry²³.

### Task 3: Hands-On Practical with Docker

**Creating a Dockerfile:**
1. **Use an official base image:** `FROM node:14`
2. **Copy application code:** `COPY . /app`
3. **Install dependencies:** `RUN npm install`
4. **Expose a port:** `EXPOSE 3000`
5. **Define a CMD:** `CMD ["npm", "start"]`

**Build and Run Docker Image:**
- **Build:** `docker build -t my-app .`
- **Run:** `docker run -p 3000:3000 my-app`

**Managing Docker Containers:**
- **List containers:** `docker ps -a`
- **Start a container:** `docker start <container_id>`
- **Stop a container:** `docker stop <container_id>`
- **Remove a container:** `docker rm <container_id>`

### Task 4: Container Orchestration and Networking

**Docker Networking Models:**
1. **Bridge Network:** Default network driver, suitable for standalone containers²³.
2. **Host Network:** Shares the host’s networking namespace²³.
3. **Overlay Network:** Used for multi-host networking, typically in swarm mode²³.

**Hands-On Networking:**
- **Create a bridge network:** `docker network create my-bridge-network`
- **Run containers on this network:** `docker run -d --name container1 --network my-bridge-network my-app`
- **Verify communication:** Use `docker exec` to run commands inside the containers and test connectivity.

### Task 5: Docker Networking and Storage

**Custom Network Configuration:**
- **Set up a custom network:** `docker network create --driver bridge my-custom-network`
- **Run a container with this network:** `docker run -d --name my-container --network my-custom-network my-app`

**Persistent Storage Solutions:**
- **Volumes:** Managed by Docker, suitable for sharing data between containers²³.
- **Bind Mounts:** Maps a host directory to a container directory²³.

**Create a Docker Container with a Mounted Volume:**
- **Run with volume:** `docker run -d -v my-volume:/app/data my-app`
- **Verify persistence:** Check data in `/app/data` after container restart.

### Submission

**Documentation:**
- Combine all written reports and explanations into a single PDF document.
- Ensure all code snippets, commands, and explanations are clearly formatted.

**Code and Configurations:**
- Submit all relevant Dockerfiles, scripts, and configuration files.

**Screenshots:**
- Include screenshots for Docker installations and running containers.
